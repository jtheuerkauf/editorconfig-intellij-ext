# `.editorconfig` IntelliJ Extensions

This repository starts out as just a list of all IntelliJ extensions to the `.editorconfig` file. As of initialization, there's no comprehensive documentation from JetBrains listing all settings they provide, so the list is manually obtained and maintained by opening a JetBrains IDE and looking for new entries that aren't already listed.

## Now

I'll organize the entries with descriptions and values. This will be based on completion suggestions from JetBrains IDEs, so I can't guarantee that all settings will be included, but I'll do my best to keep the list up to date.

## Later

Options:

* Keep as a standalone extension to the `editorconfig-vscode` plugin
* Incorporate into [my fork](https://github.com/jtheuerkauf/editorconfig-vscode) and/or submit back to the [original plugin](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode). This would allow users to install the original plugin without the extensions, if they want.
