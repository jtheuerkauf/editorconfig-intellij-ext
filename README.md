# `.editorconfig` IntelliJ Extensions

This repository starts out as just a list of all IntelliJ extensions to the `.editorconfig` file. As of initialization, there's no comprehensive documentation from JetBrains listing all of the settings they provide, so the list is manually obtained and maintained by opening a JetBrains IDE and looking for new entries that aren't already listed.

## Now

I'll attempt to provide a description for each item (or groups, when a setting repeats across supported languages).

## Later

This may become a standalone extension to the main [`editorconfig-vscode`](https://github.com/jtheuerkauf/editorconfig-vscode), rather than embedding the functional code into that repo. It would allow users to install the original plugin without this, if they want.
